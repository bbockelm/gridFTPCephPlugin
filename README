This provides a gridFTP plugin to access ceph data stores.

It builds with cmake and will create a libglobus_gridftp_server_ceph.so file to be used when launching the server.
Something like : /usr/sbin/globus-gridftp-server -dsi ceph -allowed-modules ceph

URL Syntax:
[USERID_IGNORED]@pool[,nbStripes[,stripeUnit[,objectSize]]]:object-path

The USERID is taken from the GSI account mapping. This has been tested with grid-mapfile.
The storage pool must be specified in the URL.
The object-path can include a leading slash, if desired. However, this is not required.

The environment variable GRIDFTP_CEPH_DEFAULTS is no longer used. Defaults for nbStripes (1), stripeUnit (4MiB), and objectSize (4MiB) are compiled into the DSI code.
